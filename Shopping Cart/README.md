# Building a OOP Shopping Cart with vanilla PHP ©️ Classes 🛒

Greetings [#grasshoppers](#building-a-oop-shopping-cart-with-vanilla-php--classes-)!🖖🦗

For this one, we are going to create a minimal php boilerplate.
If you want to replicate this study case, make sure to correctly set up a php environment like [Wamp](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/) Server or [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html) Server.

### Tutorial 📚

Don't expect anything fancy, we'll keep it simple. Back to roots, to dev school with simple OOP lessons. [Why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/oya2sd/an_idiot_admires_complexity_a_genius_admires/)

- The main idea: [10 Must-do small PHP projects to include in portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEkSfymY6mk).
- For this exercise item *[Build shopping cart with OOP | PHP project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ip7_hdSqzY)* by *[TheCodeholic](https://thecodeholic.com/)*.

We will follow along with the video on the `complete` branch, so the `main` branch will be the starting point for those who want to replicate the lesson.

This is all the context this subdirectory needs.

See you in the next one...
